                MWDE is a mod tool for
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_III:_Morrowind">
                The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</a>.
                It allows you to search and explore Morrowind's dialog topics
                and responses.
                It has a command-line interface, which might get some getting
                used to! But it'll be easy once you've got the hang of it.

            <h2>Setting up and using MWDE</h2>
            <div class="sep"></div>
            <p>
                To run MWDE, you'll need to have
                <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>
                installed on your computer.
                MWDE is compatible with recent Python 2.x and Python 3.x
                versions. That means it will be hard for you to
                accidentally download a version of Python that doesn't
                work with MWDE.
                (If your computer runs OSX, then it probably
                had Python already installed when you got it.)
                <li>
                    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html">How to install Python on Windows</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html">How to install Python on OSX</a>
                </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once Python is installed on your computer, you will need
                to download Morrowind Dialog Explorer and unzip the
                archive. (The download link is at the top of this page.)
                You will need to set up MWDE by going into the extracted
                folder and opening the file named "config.ini".
                INI files are only a special kind of text file, so you
                can edit it with Notepad or your choice of plain text
                editor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside "config.ini" is a lot of text to help you understand
                how it works. The most important part is to enter the
                paths to the Morrowind data files you want to load inside
                the "load_file_paths" section.
                Normally, this would be the paths to your Morrowind.esm,
                Tribunal.esm, and Bloodmoon.esm files.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you've set up your file paths, you're ready to run
                MWDE. Go back to the folder. (The same one "config.ini" is in.)
                On Windows, double-click on "Morrowind Dialog Explorer.bat".
                On OSX, open "Morrowind Dialog Explorer.app" instead.
                A new console window will open and it will show something
                like this.
                (Linux users should open a command line, navigate to the
                unzipped MWDE directory, and run "python src/dialog_explorer.py".)

                Mages Guild and Ra'Virr, a trader in Balmora.

                <br>Actor: nine_toes  (Blades Trainers)
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I offer training, but only to Blades.

                <br>Actor: nine_toes  (Blades Trainers)
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basics we can teach you, won't cost much. Advanced training, though...
                that's expensive. If you're already skilled, you're much harder to teach.
                Maybe I can help you out. Here's a little moon sugar, on the house. You do
                know that trade in moon sugar and skooma is against the law, and most
                alchemists and apothecaries won't buy it. But Khajiit generally will. Try
                Ajira at the Balmora Mages Guild, or Ra'Virr, the trader in Balmora. Sell the
                sugar, and start saving for training.

                <br>Class: Publican  (Cyrodiilic brandy)
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyrodiilic brandy, an invigorating and stimulating alcoholic beverage, is
                imported and expensive in Morrowind, but it is claimed to have none of the
                unpleasant side effects of other intoxicants. I hear it fortifies Willpower
                and Endurance. I don't know, myself... I save this for paying customers.

                <br>Class: Publican  (Telvanni bug musk)
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telvanni bug musk is an expensive perfume made from the scent glands of
                Grazelands beetles. The substance is sold in sealed flasks, and appears as a
                dark red-brown paste. The subtle but compelling fragrance is attractive to all
                mortal races and all sexes. Even a barbarian can be persuasive wearing this
                perfume.

                <br>Class: Publican  &  Cell: Mournhold  (Godsreach)
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Godsreach is on the western side of the city. There are a number of manors
                there, owned by some of the more wealthy citizens. You'll also find the
                Craftsmen's Hall, which is a fine place to find armor and weapons. They'll
                even make them to order, provided you have the materials. You can check out
                the Winged Guar Tavern as well. Not a bad place for a drink, or if you need a
                place to stay for the night. You might check out the Museum of Artifacts as
                well. The curator is always trying to add to the collection.

                forget everything he said.
