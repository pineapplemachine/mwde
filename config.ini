[load_file_paths]

; A list of ESM and ESP files to load goes here. You will need to find
; and copy the paths to your own files. Here is an example of what this
; might look like. (Your own list of file paths should NOT have
; semicolons ";" before them. Lines starting with semicolons ";" are
; ignored by MWDE.)
; The order of file paths in this list DOES matter! They should appear
; here in the same order as they would in Morrowind's mod load order.

; paths = 
;     C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Morrowind\Data Files\Morrowind.esm
;     C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Morrowind\Data Files\Tribunal.esm
;     C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Morrowind\Data Files\Bloodmoon.esm

[colors]

; When set to "true", matches in the results of "sub" and "re" queries
; will be highlighted using ANSI escape codes to help them stand out.
; When set to "false", "sub" and "re" matches won't be highlighted.
substring_colors = true

; When set to "true", scripts belonging to responses shown with a search
; using the "-V" flag will use syntax highlighting. When set to "false",
; scripts will be written to the console in all one color.
script_colors = true

; When set to "true", the functions and variables for dialog response
; conditions that show using the "-V" flag will use colors for better
; readability. When set to "false", it'll all be the same color.
function_colors = true

; When set to "true", the NPC list output by the "npcat" command will
; use colors to make location names more visually distinct. When set to
; "false", the list will be printed in a uniform color.
npcat_colors = true

; Most terminals support ANSI escape codes but, sadly, the Windows command
; prompt is not among them. When you run MWDE on Windows using the
; MWDE BAT file, colors will be disabled. If you want to get fancy,
; you can download some other command line program like ConEmu, navigate
; to the MWDE folder, and run "python src/dialog_explorer.py" directly.
; Doing this will get you all the colors.
